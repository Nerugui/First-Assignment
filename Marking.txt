Have a lot of underlying code that 
wasn't implemented but is completed for future
use and a good groundwork /foundation for this
project. Didn't have everything completed but 
I feel like there was a lot of effort and time
put into this project. We have a lot of 
implementation, and the result turned out great.

Unfortunately, we didn't have time to implement
the rest of the things we wanted and expand the
level further. But what we have right now is 
a lot.

I think with what we did would equate to a 95%
mark. Losing 5% for not impletmenting the 
health(though the ui for it is done and 
functional), and taking damage and ammo system.

We have two guns(though pistol wasn't 
implemented to do damage to enemies and no 
weapon swap). Navmesh functionality, enemies
with AI, and they also die. Destructable walls,
trigger events and various other things. It 
was a fun project to create overall. 

I worked together with Giancarlo Mora. 

Thank you
