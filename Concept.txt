As requested for making a game concept for our FPS project for the end of the semester:

I really enjoyed the game "Super Smash TV" for the SNES as a kid. So I was thinking of mimicking that concept for my FPS game.
So essentially, the player would have to clear rooms of enemies to advance and try to get as far as possible through the levels.
I'm hoping to add a few different weapon types and maybe some mechanics depending on how much time permits and my limited experience with unity allows.

Thank you
